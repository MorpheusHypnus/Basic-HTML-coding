                Standards-Based Approach for Offering a Managed Security Services in a Multivendor Network Environment.
                <br>By Kunjal Trivedi, Cisco Systems and Damien Holloway, Juniper Networks
            </p>
            <p>
                A standards-based approach helps service providers take the best advantage of the managed security service opportunity because it increases the potential breadth and depth of the service offering. Multivendor solutions are becoming the norm when deploying services on an integrated backbone. Therefore, standards simplify deployment and management, helping control operational costs and accelerating time to market.

GOD’S BOUQUET
by Jerry Johnson

With love and grace.  God filled a vase
With flowers of every hue.
Around it.  He set
Some baby’s breath.
Cut from. His garden too.

Once content, to earth. He sent
His bouquet for all to view.
So that we might recall.
The beauty of it all.
He named it after you

            “It’s a disappointment.” <cite>Nick Hellman. The Gates Foundation’s interim director of HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis</cite> said in an interview. He noted that developing drugs is a “long, tortuous road,” but said “we have to proceed, stay the course and learn more lessons about what is required for the optimum microbicide product.”
